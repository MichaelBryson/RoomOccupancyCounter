# Room Occupancy Counter
Created by: Michael Bryson and Donavan Greenley

The "Bidirectional Room Occupancy Counter" was our capstone engineering project at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan.
We designed and prototyped a device to automatically count people as they pass through a doorway and keep a running tally of the number of people in a room. This information was then used to control an external light source. 

This repository contains the Arduino code we wrote to control the device as well as the Qt Creator code for a custom desktop application that interfaced with the device. 

The purpose of this repository is NOT to distribute the code or project documentation but rather to showcase the code to interested parties (potential employers).
